		<p class="desc">"Central Texas is among the fastest growing regions in the nation. But for many of our neighbors, that growth comes at a high cost. The Central Texas Food Bank is at the front line of hunger relief with the help of roughly 250 Partner Agencies in 21 counties across Central Texas. The largest hunger relief organization in Central Texas, we bring more than 30 years of experience and industry knowledge to our method. We fight hunger the Central Texas way. Our programs and services are uniquely designed to serve our neighbors in the ways they need most.""</p>
